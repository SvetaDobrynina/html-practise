<h1>Your lifestyle photographer in Ottawa</h1>

<p>Hello! I am Sveta Dobrynina, a lifestyle photographer based in Ottawa, reglarly published. <br />
I do portraits, family photo shoots, couple love stories, business portraits, personal branding photography.</p>

<p>More <a href="./public/about.html">about me</a>.</p>

<p>I can easily deal with the most active toddler, boring teenager, or your partner whom you have been persuading 
for a long time to come to the photo shoot (yes, I also have such a partner - my husband does not like to be photographed in any form!). 
I respect clients' privacy concerns and never post their photos without permission.</p>
